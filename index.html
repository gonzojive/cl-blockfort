Blockfort attempts to support a wide range of these high-level database abstractions and provide all the necessary primitives. </p><p>Importantly, Blockfort is distributed database system that is intended to scale well to many database nodes.  Of course, blockfort supports single-node operation, but the ability to scale a system is important and so Blockfort acknowledges a possible distributed nature and provides the appropriate primitives for high-level paradigms to operate. </p><h2>Contents</h2><ol><li><a href='#guide'>User Guide</a></li><ol><li><a href='#download'>Download and Installation</a></li><li><a href='#acid'>ACID</a></li><li><a href='#architecture'>System Architecture</a></li><ol><li><a href='#server'>Servers</a></li></ol></ol></ol><h2>User Guide</h2><a name='guide'></a><h3>Download and Installation</h3><a name='download'></a><p>All the code is maintained in a git repository.  To obtain the library, use the following command: </p><pre><code>git clone git://github.com/gonzojive/cl-blockfort.git </code></pre><p>You can also browse the code at <a href="http://github.com/gonzojive/cl-blockfort">http://github.com/gonzojive/cl-blockfort</a>. </p><h3>ACID</h3><a name='acid'></a><p>Blockfort guarantees that certain behaviors are ACID compliant in its own sense and allows applications that call into Blockfort to guarantee ACID compliance in a way that makes sense for the application.  ACID transactions guarantee the following properties: </p><ul><li><p><em>Atomicity</em> -- The transaction executes either all or none of its operations.</p></li><li><p><em>Consistency</em> -- The database is in a "consistent" state before and after the transaction executes. </p></li><li><p><em>Isolation</em> -- Concurrent transactions appear to be executing one after another, and they do not reflect intermediate changes made by each other. </p></li><li><em>Durability</em> -- After a transaction has successfully committed, the database will reflect its changes. </li></ul><h3>System Architecture</h3><a name='architecture'></a><p>To accomplish ACID compliance, Blockfort relies on two basic principles: <a href="#transactions">transaction logging</a> for <a href="#recovery">recovering</a> from failures, and a concurrency scheduler for dealing with concurrently-executing transactions.  How ACID compliance is achieved in light of the rather agnostic nature of Blockfort in regards to the higher-level structure of its data should become clear after reading about blocks, concurrency control, and the interface between the two in Blockfort. </p><p><img src="architecture.png" alt="System architecture diagram"></img> </p><p>The above diagram illustrates the basic architecture of a blockstore-based database system.
